# Phaxio2Docparser

This app will let you post accept Phaxio receive callbacks and POST the files they contain to a Docparser parser.  You'll need:

* A Docparser account with a parser set up
* A Phaxio account

To use, simply click the Heroku launch button below and enter your Docparser parser ID and API secret.  Then update your receive callback URL in Phaxio to be the URL of this deployed app.

That's it!
